# Hotel management

This is a university project. It is a hotel management system programmed in Java. 

## Requirements
- Java should be installed and running on your device 

(\**JDK version 11+ should work fine, I havent tested it. But I am running JDK version 19. If it doesn't work on older versions, either raise an issue or try installing a newer version.*)


## Instructions for running

Download the file and run the following:
```bash
$ javac HotelAnas.java
$ java HotelAnas
```
This should execute the program as expected. If not please raise an issue in the **Issues** tab. 

Thank You.
